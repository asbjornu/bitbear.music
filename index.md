Bitbear is [Asbj√∏rn Ulsberg][asbjornu]'s tone-hammering, beat-juggling
and [demoscene]-participating alter ego.

## About

Bitbear started fiddling with music in Pro Tracker on the Amiga 500 in the
early 90s. But first when he got his hands on Scream Tracker and Fast Tracker
on a PC, he started producing "real" music under the alias "Power of Creation".

He created two albums and submitted songs to various demoscene competitions
throughout the 90's until he put his musical career on the shelf until it was
rebooted in 2012 by entering the Kindergarden 2012 Dance Music Competition under
the new-found alias Bitbear.

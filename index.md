Bitbear is [Asbj√∏rn Ulsberg][asbjornu]'s tone-hammering, beat-juggling
and [demoscene]-participating alter ego.

## Music

If you're interested in listening to my music, then head over the [music]
section of this site.

## About

I started fiddling with music in [NoiseTracker] and [ProTracker] on the [Amiga
500][amiga] in the early 90s. But first when I got my hands on [Scream
Tracker][scream-tracker], [Fast Tracker II][fast-tracker], and ultimately
[Impulse Tracker][impulse-tracker] on an [IBM-compatible PC][pc], I started
producing "real" music under the alias *Power of Creation*.

I created the two albums [Beyond Fantasy][beyond-fantasy] and [3rd
Floor][3rd-floor], and submitted songs to various [demoscene] competitions
throughout the 90s. In the early 2000s, I put my musical career on the shelf
until it was rebooted in 2012 by entering the [Kindergarden 2012 Dance Music
Competition][kg2012] under the new-found alias *Bitbear*.

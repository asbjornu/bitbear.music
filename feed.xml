song I had created so far, tracking in at 1 minute and 45 seconds before

only 22 seconds, looped.</p>

<p>I remember being quite proud of this one, and the blurb I wrote in the sample
text is proof of my over-the-top confidence:</p>

  <p>Another chip by <abbr title="Power of Creation, Bitbear's alias">PoC</abbr>. I’m like an industrial Chip Fabric! 5 chips has been

</blockquote>

<p>Never mind that while translating the Norwegian word “fabrikk” to English, I was
clueless to the fact that “fabric” means “cloth” and not “factory”. I still
think the name “Chip Fabric” has a cool sound to it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Asbjørn Ulsberg</name><email>mail@bitbear.org</email></author><category term="music" /><category term="legacy" /><category term="chip" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitbear.org is the website of electronic music producer Asbjørn Ulsberg]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Crossed Heart</title><link href="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/crossed-heart" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Crossed Heart" /><published>1996-01-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>1996-01-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/crossed-heart</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/crossed-heart"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="/music/legacy/tiny-chips-revenge">Tiny Chip’s Revenge</a>, I was on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune">chip</a> production spree and made

<a href="/music/chiptunes">chiptune</a> produced as an <abbr title="Scream Tracker 3 Module">S3M</abbr>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>“Tiny Chip’s Revenge” was produced during Christmas of 1995 for a diskmag called
“Ultramag #1”, but I have no idea what happened to it, who was going to make it,
or whether it was ever made.</p>

<p>Unreleased as it seemingly were, I entered the <abbr title="File size of 10 kilobytes">10k</abbr> chip tune into the <a href="https://demozoo.org/parties/3172/#competition_13406">Solskogen
2017 Oldskool Music Competition</a> under the name <a href="https://demozoo.org/music/174672/">Ferris III Y.O.</a>
as a nod of admiration and pull of leg to <a href="https://iamferris.com/">Ferris</a> only being 3 years old when
it was produced. As noted in the <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/174672/info/2773/">file info</a> of <a href="https://demozoo.org/music/174672/">the Solskogen
entry</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sole thing I achieve is proving how awesome he is and how lame I am,
though. I’m quite certain Ferris could make better music than this when he was
15 years old. So infinite amounts of love and respect to Ferris!</p>

<p>And I still stand firmly by those words. :)</p>]]></content><author><name>Asbjørn Ulsberg</name><email>mail@bitbear.org</email></author><category term="music" /><category term="legacy" /><category term="chip" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitbear.org is the website of electronic music producer Asbjørn Ulsberg]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Floot Ride</title><link href="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/the-floot-ride" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Floot Ride" /><published>1995-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>1995-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/the-floot-ride</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/the-floot-ride"><![CDATA[<p>“The Floote Ride” was one of the the first tracker modules I feel somewhat
content with, at least now.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I made it on <abbr title="1995-12-14">Thursday, December 14th 1995</abbr> when I was still calling myself “PCi”, but made a little
change to the loop offset of the flute on <abbr title="1996-02-04">Sunday, February 4th 1996</abbr> and then
published the song under <abbr title="Power of Creation">PoC</abbr> as that was the name I took in late December 1995.</p>

<p>The instrument text describes this as well as a few other stupid things I found
it meaningful to write as a 15 year old boy with too much time on his hands:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know, I know: THIS IS CRAP! But what should I do in my spare time? Sew?!?
This is a typical spare-time-problem-song, which I made in about 1,5h
14/12-95, but the final changes was made in 4/2-96, and that was the
offsetting of the Flooooote! It said “Click” each time a new tone was
played. Not a very good Instrument, but I didn’t make it my self so what do you
expect? I kinda’ like the drums though… Greets to the sampler of them! -
Whoever that is.</p>

the file says <abbr title="1997-12-02">Tuesday, December 2nd 1997</abbr>, which must be wrong as by then I had
produced a lot of songs that I would have considered to be “techno”.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I believe I started and mostly completed this late in 1995 and finally finished
it some time in 1996, where all I did was add the choir intro. That explains
signing the song as <abbr title="Power of Creation">PoC</abbr> in the song’s instrument list, because while I created
this song originally, I still went by the handle “PCi”.</p>

<p>To best fit with the chronology and development of my music abilities, I
therefore date “First Techno Attempt” to <abbr title="1995-07-01">Saturday, July 1st 1995</abbr> although that isn’t exactly
correct.</p>

<p>Regarding the song’s title, please don’t mind that the song isn’t in the
“techno” genre by any stretch of the imagination. To me and most of my friends
back in the mid 1990’s, “techno” was just a synonym for “electronic music”.</p>

<p>I remember being quite happy about this song back when I produced it, and I
quite like it to this day as well.</p>]]></content><author><name>Asbjørn Ulsberg</name><email>mail@bitbear.org</email></author><category term="music" /><category term="legacy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitbear.org is the website of electronic music producer Asbjørn Ulsberg]]></summary></entry></feed>

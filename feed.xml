for brevity’s sake. I would have preferred not to have made this trash at all,

it in me to delete it.

attempt at creating something more mellow and harmonic. As noted in the song’s
sample text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><abbr title="Power of Creation">PoC</abbr> created this sorrow-filled song. I’m not good in making names for my
songs, so “Fat Ma’s Death” was only thing I could come up with!
The name has nothing to do with a experience I’ve had!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With its many different parts and harmonies, it was the longest and most varied
song I had created so far, tracking in at 1 minute and 45 seconds before
looping.</p>]]></content><author><name>Asbjørn Ulsberg</name><email>mail@bitbear.org</email></author><category term="music" /><category term="legacy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitbear.org is the website of electronic music producer Asbjørn Ulsberg]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Final Countdown</title><link href="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/final-countdown" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Final Countdown" /><published>1996-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>1996-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/final-countdown</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/final-countdown"><![CDATA[<p>My first attempt at a cover song was of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_(band)">Europe</a>’s epic song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Countdown_(song)">The Final

<abbr title="10 kilobytes">10 kB</abbr>, it’s within the limits of what one would consider a “chip tune” back when
I produced this as a 15-year old in January 1996. It’s also a very short tune of
only 22 seconds, looped.</p>

<p>I remember being quite proud of this one, and the blurb I wrote in the sample
text is proof of my over-the-top confidence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another chip by <abbr title="Power of Creation, Bitbear's alias">PoC</abbr>. I’m like an industrial Chip Fabric! 5 chips has been
produced on my <abbr title="An Intel Pentium 60 MHz processor-powered IBM-Compatible Personal Computer.">P60</abbr> in the last week! I must be special…?(NOT!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never mind that while translating the Norwegian word “fabrikk” to English, I was
clueless to the fact that “fabric” means “cloth” and not “factory”. I still
think the name “Chip Fabric” has a cool sound to it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Asbjørn Ulsberg</name><email>mail@bitbear.org</email></author><category term="music" /><category term="legacy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitbear.org is the website of electronic music producer Asbjørn Ulsberg]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Crossed Heart</title><link href="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/crossed-heart" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Crossed Heart" /><published>1996-01-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>1996-01-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/crossed-heart</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/crossed-heart"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="/music/legacy/tiny-chips-revenge">Tiny Chip’s Revenge</a>, I was on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune">chip</a> production spree and made

was my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune">chip tune</a> produced as an <abbr title="Scream Tracker 3 Module">S3M</abbr>.</p>

<p>Originally, “chip tunes” had to be produced on hardware with actual synthesizers
on a chip – hence the name – such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6581">SID</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX
Spectrum’s</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Instrument_AY-3-8910">AY-3-8910</a>. On the Amiga and IBM PC, no such standard
synthesizer chips were available, so “chip tunes” were rather faithful
emulations produced using samples.</p>

<p>Besides the oldschool sound, the other defining characteristic of chip tunes was
file size. Somewhere around 10 kilobytes was usually the upper file size limit
and had to be adhered to if you wanted to participate in a chip tune
competition.</p>

<p>“Tiny Chip’s Revenge” was produced during Christmas of 1995 for a diskmag called
“Ultramag #1”, but I have no idea what happened to it, who was going to make it,
or whether it was ever made.</p>

<p>Unreleased as it seemingly were, I entered the <abbr title="File size of 10 kilobytes">10k</abbr> chip tune into the <a href="https://demozoo.org/parties/3172/#competition_13406">Solskogen
2017 Oldskool Music Competition</a> under the name <a href="https://demozoo.org/music/174672/">Ferris III Y.O.</a>
as a nod of admiration and pull of leg to <a href="https://iamferris.com/">Ferris</a> only being 3 years old when
it was produced. As noted in the <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/174672/info/2773/">file info</a> of <a href="https://demozoo.org/music/174672/">the Solskogen
entry</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sole thing I achieve is proving how awesome he is and how lame I am,
though. I’m quite certain Ferris could make better music than this when he was
15 years old. So infinite amounts of love and respect to Ferris!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I still stand firmly by those words. :)</p>]]></content><author><name>Asbjørn Ulsberg</name><email>mail@bitbear.org</email></author><category term="music" /><category term="legacy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitbear.org is the website of electronic music producer Asbjørn Ulsberg]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Floot Ride</title><link href="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/the-floot-ride" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Floot Ride" /><published>1995-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>1995-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/the-floot-ride</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bitbear.org/music/legacy/the-floot-ride"><![CDATA[<p>“The Floote Ride” was the fourth tracker module I produced, and the first one I

This horrible song is shamefully published for brevity and nothing else. I had
forgotten that it even existed until I unearthed it among my old music archive
on {% date '2023-01-23' %}.

I'm not exactly sure when "Mortal Silence" was made, so the date is a guess, but
judging from its extremely poor quality and the fact that I was still calling
myself "PCi" in the module's instrument list, I'd say it was one of my very
first tracker modules made as a 15 year old on {% date %}.

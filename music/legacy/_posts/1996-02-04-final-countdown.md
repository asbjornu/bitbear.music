My first attempt at a cover song was of [Europe]'s epic song [The Final
Countdown][final-countdown], which since I first heard it in 1986, thought had
one of the best synth lead melodies ever written.

Produced as a 4-channel chiptune, I remember struggling with both the chords
and timing. It didn't end up as a perfect chip rendition of the original, but
being a musically untrained 15-year old when I made it, I think it came out
okay.

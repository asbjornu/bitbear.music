"The Floote Ride" was one of the the first tracker modules I feel somewhat
content with, at least now.

<!--more-->

I made it on {% date %} when I was still calling myself "PCi", but made a little
change to the loop offset of the flute on {% date '1996-02-04' %} and then
published the song under PoC as that was the name I took in late December 1995.

The instrument text describes this as well as a few other stupid things I found
it meaningful to write as a 15 year old boy with too much time on his hands:

> I know, I know: THIS IS CRAP! But what should I do in my spare time? Sew?!?
> This is a typical spare-time-problem-song, which I made in about 1,5h
> 14/12-95, but the final changes was made in 4/2-96, and that was the
> offsetting of the Flooooote! It said "Click" each time a new tone was
> played. Not a very good Instrument, but I didn't make it my self so what do you
> expect? I kinda' like the drums though... Greets to the sampler of them! -
> Whoever that is.

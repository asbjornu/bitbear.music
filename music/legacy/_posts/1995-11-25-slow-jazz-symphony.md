While being neither jazz, nor a symphony, I'm quite content with some parts of
"Slow Jazz Symphony". <!--more--> Except the bridge part, of course, which is
horrible.

It took me quite a while to figure out exactly how to properly structure songs
and ensure that each part served a purpose. As the untrained 15 year old
musician I was when I made this, those skills were not yet developed.

When producing the song on {% date %}, I remember experimenting with different
chords and managed to find a few that fit well together, and wrote a half-decent
melody to go with them.

By late 1995 I was mostly tracking in Scream Tracker 3 and this was my first
[chiptune] produced as an S3M.

"Tiny Chip's Revenge" was produced during Christmas of 1995 for a diskmag called
"Ultramag #1", but I have no idea what happened to it, who was going to make it,
or whether it was ever made.

Unreleased as it seemingly were, I entered the 10k chip tune into the [Solskogen
2017 Oldskool Music Competition][compo] under the name [Ferris III Y.O.][entry]
as a nod of admiration and pull of leg to [Ferris] only being 3 years old when
it was produced. As noted in the [file info][info] of [the Solskogen
entry][entry]:

> The sole thing I achieve is proving how awesome he is and how lame I am,
> though. Iâ€™m quite certain Ferris could make better music than this when he was
> 15 years old. So infinite amounts of love and respect to Ferris!

And I still stand firmly by those words. :)

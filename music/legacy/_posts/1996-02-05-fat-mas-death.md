This horribly named [chiptune] produced in early February 1996 was my first
attempt at creating something more mellow and harmonic. As noted in the song's
sample text:

> PoC created this sorrow-filled song. I'm not good in making names for my
> songs, so "Fat Ma's Death" was only thing I could come up with!
> The name has nothing to do with a experience I've had!

With its many different parts and harmonies, it was the longest and most varied
song I had created so far, tracking in at 1 minute and 45 seconds before
looping.

<p>I have no idea when I actually produced “First Techno Attempt” as the date on
the file says <abbr title="1997-12-02">Tuesday, December 2nd 1997</abbr>, which must be wrong as by then I had
produced a lot of songs that I would have considered to be “techno”.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I believe I started and mostly completed this late in 1995 and finally finished
it some time in 1996, where all I did was add the choir intro. That explains
signing the song as <abbr title="Power of Creation">PoC</abbr> in the song’s instrument list, because while I created
this song originally, I still went by the handle “PCi”.</p>

<p>To best fit with the chronology and development of my music abilities, I
therefore date “First Techno Attempt” to <abbr title="1995-07-01">Saturday, July 1st 1995</abbr> although that isn’t exactly
correct.</p>

<p>Regarding the song’s title, please don’t mind that the song isn’t in the
“techno” genre by any stretch of the imagination. To me and most of my friends
back in the mid 1990’s, “techno” was just a synonym for “electronic music”.</p>

<p>I remember being quite happy about this song back when I produced it, and I
quite like it to this day as well.</p>

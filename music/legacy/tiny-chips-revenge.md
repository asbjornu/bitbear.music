By late 1995 I was mostly tracking in Scream Tracker 3 and "Tiny Chip's Revenge"
was my first [chip tune][chip] produced as an S3M.

Originally, "chip tunes" had to be produced on hardware with actual synthesizers
on a chip – hence the name – such as [Commodore 64][c64]'s [SID] or [ZX
Spectrum's][zx] [AY-3-8910]. On the Amiga and IBM PC, no such standard
synthesizer chips were available, so "chip tunes" were rather faithful
emulations produced using samples.

Besides the oldschool sound, the other defining characteristic of chip tunes was
file size. Somewhere around 10 kilobytes was usually the upper file size limit
and had to be adhered to if you wanted to participate in a chip tune
competition.

"Tiny Chip's Revenge" was produced during Christmas of 1995 for a diskmag called
"Ultramag #1", but I have no idea what happened to it, who was going to make it,
or whether it was ever made.

Unreleased as it seemingly were, I entered the 10k chip tune into the [Solskogen
2017 Oldskool Music Competition][compo] under the name [Ferris III Y.O.][entry]
as a nod of admiration and pull of leg to [Ferris] only being 3 years old when
it was produced. As noted in the [file info][info] of [the Solskogen
entry][entry]:

> The sole thing I achieve is proving how awesome he is and how lame I am,
> though. I’m quite certain Ferris could make better music than this when he was
> 15 years old. So infinite amounts of love and respect to Ferris!

And I still stand firmly by those words. :)

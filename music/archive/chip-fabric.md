Sound-wise, "Chip Fabric" isn't very chippy, but with a file size of less than
10 kB, it's within the limits of what one would consider a "chip tune" back when
I produced this as a 15-year old in January 1996. It's also a very short tune of
only 22 seconds, looped.

I remember being quite proud of this one, and the blurb I wrote in the sample
text is proof of my over-the-top confidence:

> Another chip by PoC. I'm like an industrial Chip Fabric! 5 chips has been
> produced on my P60 in the last week! I must be special...?(NOT!)

Never mind that while translating the Norwegian word "fabrikk" to English, I was
clueless to the fact that "fabric" means "cloth" and not "factory". I still
think the name "Chip Fabric" has a cool sound to it.
